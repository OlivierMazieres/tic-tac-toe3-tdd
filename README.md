# Tic-Tac-Toe TDD Implementation

![Tests](https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/tic-tac-toe-tdd/actions/workflows/tests.yml/badge.svg)

A Test-Driven Development implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with:

- X goes first
- Alternating turns
- Win detection (rows, columns, diagonals)
- Draw detection
- Validation

## Rules Implemented

1. X always goes first
2. Players alternate placing X's and O's
3. No moves on occupied spaces
4. Win when 3 in a row (any direction)
5. Draw when board is full
6. Game ends when win/draw occurs

## How It Works

1. Tests drive implementation
2. GitHub Actions runs tests on every push
3. 100% test coverage
